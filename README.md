# Objecet-detection-training


To train this model download pretrained YOLOv3 model and convert the model to keras model using convert.py then run train.py
I used OIDV4 tool kit to download datasets.

Due to less computational power of my computer, i only trained the model by 5 epochs. 
The performance should  increase if more classes are added and epochs are increased
